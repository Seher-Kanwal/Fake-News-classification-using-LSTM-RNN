Text classification task is generally considered to be a difficult task, the main reason for this is long term dependencies found in a text. Recently, there has been a huge development in the field of deep learning to solve tasks in Natural Language Processing. From task like machine translation to machine comprehension to image captioning, deep learning has proved to be an outstanding approach to solve such a range of problems
